BYU CS Student's Research Helps Texas Rangers Win 2023 World Series


            Will Melville, a PhD student in the BYU Computer Science Department, works as an analyst with the Texas Rangers. The Texas Rangers desire to strengthen their defense led him to research new defensive positioning strategies. The Rangers won the World Series in November 2023 using a version of Melville’s model to position their outfielders, and this year they are using the model to position the infielders as well.

Melville was presented a World Series Ring for his contribution.

Student Stories


          Computer Science at BYU has helped me achieve my dream job even before graduating. It has also helped me to be involved in an amazing campus and tremendous clubs with some of the best students, faculty, and advisors. I haven't yet created impactful and influential software that helps people all over the world but connecting with some of the brightest students in the world and getting into a company where you can find some of the brightest engineers is a step closer to achieving that goal.

          I had no coding experience before coming to BYU, so I have really learned a lot in all the CS classes I have taken. Now I am a proficient coder who is ready to enter the workforce!
